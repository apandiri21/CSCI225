    <div class="portfolio">

            <li>Ultimate Fitness Website</li>
            <li>River Bluff High School Gator Town Website</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="boxshadow">My first project was the Ultimate Fitness website where we have to create a website for the client. We used photoshop to create a poster at the top of the webpage and created four navigation bars which are home, about us, contact us, and news and create a separate CSS document for each of the links. </p>
        <p>The next project I worked on was creating a webpage for our school store called Gator Town. The easy part about this assignment was where we get to work with groups since this assignment is almost the same at the previous one except this assignment was very big and complex compared to the previous project we did.</p>
